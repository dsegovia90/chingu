# Chingu-PP

Pair programming is a great - and fun! - way to build programming skills, but finding someone to program with can be tricky.

Chingu-PP makes it easy for members of the Chingu cohorts to find a pair programming partner - simply log in (or install the Chingu-PP slack app), request a partner, and wait to be matched.

Chingu-PP is a Build-to-Learn project started by members of the Honey Badgers cohort. Please be patient as we continue to work out bugs, make improvements, and add new features.

And (of course!) feel free to join in the fun!

## Getting Started

#### Using the app and website

Getting started with the website is as simple as navigating to the app ((ADD URL HERE)), and signing in. You can request a pair programming partner using a quick two-question form, and can view information on current and pending match requests.

Install the Chingu-PP app to your slack team to access additional features. The app allows you to:
- Request a pair programming partner from within Slack.
- Receive a message from the Chingu-PP bot user when you are matched.
